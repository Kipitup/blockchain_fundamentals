# Exercises and Solutions for Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC

## Introduction

Welcome to the exercises for the Web3 Foundation's Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC!

Before starting, you should be at least somewhat familiar with `git` and programming in general.  Ideally, you will also be familiar with Rust, although I tried to make the Rust code simple so that you can learn as you go along.

If you need help with Github and `git`, I recommend Github's guide here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

If you would like to learn more about Rust, I recommend The Rust Programming Language by Carol Nichols and Steve Klabnik.  Going through the first three chapters should give you enough background to work on the exercises here. https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/

_Note: It is not absolutely necessary to do any of these exercises, but they will help you understand in much more depth the topic that is covered in the relevant lecture!_

## Steps

1. Clone down this repository to your local machine.
1. Go to the `./exercises/` subdirectory, then select the appropriate exercise that you wish to work on.
1. Read through the comments at the top of the `src/main.rs` file which explains the purpose and goals of the exercise.
1. For each of the exercises, I have laid out the skeleton of a program.  You should fill in all of the methods with `TODO` in them (you can simply search for TODO using your text editor of choice).
1. You should start working starting from `TODO 1` and go in order - some of the later TODOs can depend on previous methods working.
1. You can test to see if your program is working by running `cargo test` from the root directory of that exercise.  This will run the relevant suite of unit tests for that program.
1. When you are finished, you can run the program using `cargo run`.  I will include sample runs of the code in the comments so you can see some appropriate expected output.
1. You can always check my solutions in the top-level `./solutions/` (at the same level as the `./exercises/` subdirectory) if you get stuck or simply want to compare how I did it with how you did it.
